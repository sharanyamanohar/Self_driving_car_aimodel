# Self_driving_car_aimodel

In this project, I developed a self-driving car algorithm using the Udacity simulator. I collected image data, trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and deployed the algorithm in the simulator. The self-driving car successfully navigated and made autonomous decisions based on visual input, demonstrating its capability to operate within a virtual environment.
